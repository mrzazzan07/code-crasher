Changes Made in the Code:
Your To-Do List Application has been upgraded with the following improvements:

Task Prioritization:

Users can assign a priority level (High, Medium, or Low) when adding a task.
Task Completion Feature:

Users can mark tasks as completed, displaying [âœ”] for done and [ ] for pending tasks.
Persistent Storage (File Handling):

Tasks are now saved to and loaded from a tasks.txt file.
This ensures tasks are not lost when the program is restarted.
Enhanced Task Display:

Displays task number, description, priority, and completion status.
Improved Input Handling:

Uses cin.ignore() to handle input buffering.
Prevents invalid inputs from breaking the program.
